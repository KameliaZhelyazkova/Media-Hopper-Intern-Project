== MEDIA HOPPER INTERN PROJECT ==

The aspiration of this project is to extend the capability of the University
of Edinburghâ€™s video platform Media Hopper.


== DESCRIPTION ==
The aim is to create a channel automatically populated with data specified
by a distinct license type, in this instance creative commons license type.
This would result that every time a user selects a creative commons license
and publishes content that content will be automatically added to the channel.

Another instance of its functionality is to create a unique playlist inside
the channel for each user who generates creative commons licensed content.
This allows embedding a playlist of all creative commons content in any website of a choice.


== DEPENDENCIES ==
Uses the Kaltura Python Client Library: http://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/testme/client-libs.php
This can be found in the "KalturaClient" directory.


== EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES ==
The API library depends on the following python modules that are not included by
default with python:
 - setuptools - can be downloaded from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
 - poster - can be downloaded from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/poster/
	installed by running: python setup.py install


== USAGE ==
After making sure you have the modules listed under the 'external dependencies' installed,
run the following command into the command prompt:
>> python creation_script.py


== CHANGE OF SETTINGS ==
{
  "sessionSettings": {"userID": "admin", "ksType": 2,
                      "adminSecret": "1a7227978d8228dde2a574fac2c9b371",
                      "partnerID": 1817881,"serviceUrl": "http://www.kaltura.com/"},

  "channelSettings": {"channelName": "Ada Lovelace Day", "channelDescription": "Woo",
  "channelPrivacy": 1},

  "playlistSettings": {"playlistCreation": true, "playlistName": "Ada Lovelace Day in 2016
   will be on Tuesday 11 October...", "playlistDesc": "No"},

  "filterSettings": {"filterBy":"CC","freeText":"media"}


}
You can change the Session, Channel, Playlist and Filter settings by opening
settings.json file in the KalturaClient. This is happening by entering for each
key in the sub-dictionary the desired value for the corresponding fields you would
wish to change. For instance, channelName can be modified to a new one by entering
content (preferred naming) after the colons within the quotation marks.cc

Example code:
"channelSettings": {"channelName": "Ada Lovelace Day",
                    "channelDescription": "Ada Lovelace Day in 2016 will be on Tuesday 11 October...",
                    "channelPrivacy": 1}.



In addition ksType can hold values: 0 - USER and 2 - ADMIN, channelPrivacy: 1 - ALL, 2 - AUTHENTICATED_USERS,
3 - MEMBERS_ONLY. "playlistCreation" should be set to true if you wish to
generate playlists as explained above, and to false otherwise. "filterBy" takes the value "CC" if you want to
filter by Creative Commons license type, and "freeText" to filter by keywords.
In the later case, specify the keywords in "freeText".

Analogically, for any other values of an attribute, you can check the Kaltura's API
documentation on: http://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/testmeDoc/.
